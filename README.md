# Basic Recommender System
This console application is part of the practical assignment for the INFDTA02-1 course at Hogeschool Rotterdam. It will take a dataset containing at least a (UserID, ProductID, Rating) and is able to use multiple approaches (like Collaborative or Content-based filtering) to predict the rating a user would give to an item.

## Features
The application (currently) has the following features:
* Cosine similarity
* Euclidean similarity
* Manhattan similarity
* Pearson correlation coefficient
* Calculate nearest neighbours based on a target user, a threshold and k (amount of neighbours to consider)

## Setup
Setting up is easy, open and run the solution. The application will guide you through the options. Feel free to play around with different datasets and algorithms.
